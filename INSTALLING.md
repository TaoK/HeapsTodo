## Windows

On Windows, it should just work, as long as you have .Net 3.5 installed.

## Ubuntu-derived Linux / Mono

### Regular Desktop

1. sudo apt-get install mono-complete

(target version: 2.10.x)

### Server Terminal Only

1. sudo apt-get install mono-complete
2. sudo apt-get install lynx
3. sudo apt-get install xdg-utils

## OSX / mono

how does this work?

* where to get mono
* how to ensure that mono has root certs, and URL-handler, and proper DPAPI support?
